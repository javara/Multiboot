# Multiboot
My own configuration file for GRUB2 to boot various live distributions of Linux-based operating systems, along with some system tools. I tried to include a lot of sample configuration entries, even if I don't currently use them, so it may help others. 

I'm newbie. I'm trying to fork https://gist.github.com/27203177bdef15fbb70c.git under a human-readable repository.
